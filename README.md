# BMI-CALCULATOR-
A BMI calculator is a medical screening tool used to estimate a person's body fat based on their weight relative to their height.  I have created a BMI calculator to provide an easy, quick, and accessible way for individuals and healthcare providers to estimate body fat. It helps identify potential health for a quicker and effective cure.
